# Intro #
This project is a demonstration of a tetris AI. It will basically keep playing tetris forever.
Looking back on it, creating this as a Java applet was a mistake, and it's unlikely to run in any web browser. Fortunately, oracle produce an applet viewer!

# To Run #
- Have a JDK > 7 on your path.
- cd uk\co\pmacg\tetrominos\
- javac *
- cd ..\..\..\..
- appletviewer tetrominos.html
